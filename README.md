area under the curve : statement 

Problem Statement:
Write a MIPS Assembly Program for obtaining the area under a curve formed by joining
successive points by a straight line.
Input:  (x, y) Co­ordinates of “n” points, sorted according to the x co­ordinate. Assume
integer values for the co­ordinates.  Inputs can be taken from keyboard.
Output: Print the area under the curve. The result can be floating point value aswell.
Example: For the following input consisting of 5 points, the result is   35   (area of shaded
region).
Inputs
n: 5
(X,Y) co­ordinates sorted according to X co­ordinate: (1,1) (3,4) (5,3) (6,7) (9,5)
